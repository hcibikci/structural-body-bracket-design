# Design Assumptions

## Purpose
This document outlines the key assumptions used during the conceptual design and structural analysis of the mounting bracket.  
The assumptions are intentionally simplified to reflect an early-stage engineering study.

---

## Load Assumptions
- The applied load represents a simplified static operational load
- Load direction is assumed to be primarily vertical
- Load magnitude is estimated based on typical body/interior component masses
- Dynamic, crash, and fatigue loads are excluded

---

## Boundary Conditions
- Mounting holes are assumed to be fully constrained (fixed support)
- Contact effects between fasteners and bracket are not modeled
- Load is applied as a distributed force to avoid singularities

---

## Material Behavior
- Material behavior is assumed to be linear elastic
- Isotropic material properties are used
- Plastic deformation is not considered

---

## Geometric Simplifications
- Small fillets and chamfers may be suppressed for meshing efficiency
- Threads are not explicitly modeled
- Ideal geometry is assumed without manufacturing defects

---

## Exclusions
The following aspects are intentionally excluded from this study:
- Fatigue life assessment
- Buckling analysis
- Thermal effects
- Manufacturing-induced residual stresses

---

## Engineering Intent
These assumptions are chosen to:
- Enable rapid concept validation
- Identify critical stress regions
- Support design iteration in early development phases

Further refinement would be required for production-level validation.
