# CAD Design Strategy

## Bracket Configuration
The selected configuration is a gusset-reinforced L-shaped mounting bracket.  
This geometry provides improved load transfer and reduced stress concentration compared to a simple L-bracket.

---

## Design Intent
- Efficient load path between mounting interfaces
- Minimized stress concentration at corner regions
- Balanced stiffness and weight
- Manufacturable geometry suitable for machining or sheet metal forming

---

## Key Geometric Features
- Gusset added between vertical and horizontal flanges
- Generous fillet radii at load-critical corners
- Uniform wall thickness where possible
- Chamfered edges for manufacturing and handling

---

## CAD Modeling Guidelines
- Parametric dimensions for easy iteration
- Avoid unnecessary geometric complexity
- Symmetry applied where applicable
- Design tree structured for clarity and modification

---

## CAD Tools
The geometry may be created using:
- Siemens NX
- CATIA
- SolidWorks

The modeling approach remains consistent across all platforms.

---

## Next Steps
- Initial solid model creation
- Geometry simplification for FEA
- Design iteration based on analysis feedback
