# Material Selection

## Objective
The objective of material selection is to identify a suitable material that satisfies structural performance, weight efficiency, manufacturability, and industry relevance for both automotive and aerospace applications.

---

## Design Requirements
- Sufficient yield strength under static loading
- Low mass contribution to the overall structure
- Good manufacturability and availability
- Common usage in automotive and aerospace industries

---

## Candidate Materials

### Aluminum Alloy (6061-T6 / 6082-T6)
**Advantages:**
- High strength-to-weight ratio
- Excellent machinability
- Corrosion resistance
- Widely used in automotive body and aerospace structures

**Limitations:**
- Lower stiffness compared to steel
- Cost considerations for large-scale production

---

### Aluminum Alloy (7075-T6)
**Advantages:**
- Very high strength
- Aerospace-grade material
- Suitable for highly loaded brackets

**Limitations:**
- Reduced corrosion resistance
- Higher cost
- Limited formability

---

### Structural Steel (S355 / Automotive-grade)
**Advantages:**
- High stiffness
- Cost-effective
- Well-known manufacturing processes

**Limitations:**
- Higher mass
- Corrosion protection required

---

## Selected Material (Concept Level)
For the conceptual phase, **Aluminum 6061-T6** is selected due to its balanced performance, weight efficiency, and manufacturability.

This selection aligns with early-stage automotive and aerospace structural design practices.
